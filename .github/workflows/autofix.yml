            These changes were made automatically by running [rector](https://getrector.com/) and [phpcbf](https://phpqa.io/projects/phpcbf.html).

            These tools try to ensure that your Extension's code adheres to DokuWiki's coding standards. They also try to fix common issues with newer PHP versions and replace deprecated code. 

            Please carefully check the changes before merging. Please note that unit tests are not run for automated pull requests - so if in doubt, manually test the branch before merging.

            If you disagree with the changes, simply clean the code yourself. This PR automatically closes when no more changes are suggested by rector and phpcbf.
